## Preprocessing 

Steps

- Make the scanpy data with annotation of perterbations
- Quality control
- Normalization
- Batch Correction
- Highly Variable Genes
- PCA

## Perturb-SNN
one-shot leearning with Siamese net work/ Triplet net work with triplet loss => good results 

## MAML
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (few-shot learning) 

## matchingnetwork
